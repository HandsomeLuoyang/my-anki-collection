This is an Anki card template inspired by The Wichter game for learning the conjugation and meaning of Polish verbs. I do not speak Polish myself but was requested to create this template for my friend Andrew, who sent me a draft of his idea.



## Overview of the template

This template has three parts:

 The top part includes the imperfective and perfective form of a Polish verb

The middle part includes the verb, its usage in a sentence and optional notes on whatever you want, menometic rule to remember, usage notes, quotes, etc. Click

[example optional versions when you don't write notes, etc]



The bottom part includes MANY TABLES that present the different conjugations of a polish verb in the following tenses: *bla bla bla*.
