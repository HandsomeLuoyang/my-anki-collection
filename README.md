# The Temple of Templates



**Herzlich Willkommen in meinem Tempel**!

 This is my **temple of templates**. Here you'll find some of the templates I've crafted for learning languages and for other subjects.

If you head over to the web you can see all the templates I have uploaded so far and play around with their interactive components. I'm still working on them, so some of them might behave strangely. 

So far I have uploaded the following:

- [Polish conjugation card](./templates/polish-verbs/README.md) (working on fixing some issues)
- [German vocabulary cards](./templates/german-vocab/README.md)
- [Adalab - learning web development concepts](./templates/adalab/README.md)

## How to install the templates

Most templates can just be downloaded as an anki file `.apkg` and opened  with Anki. For cards containing pictures such as the Polish conjugation it may be necessary to download the pictures and place them in the Anki program's media folder, which might differ depending on your OS.

From the [Anki manual](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual20.html#importing-media) on importing media:

> If you want to include audio and pictures from a text file import, copy the files into the [collection.media folder](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual20.html#files). **Do not put subdirectories in the media folder, or some features will not work.**

### Location of the media folder

From the [Anki manual](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual20.html#files) on file locations:

- On **Windows**, the latest Anki versions store your Anki files in your appdata folder. You can access it by opening the file manager, and typing `%APPDATA%\Anki2` in the location field. Older versions of Anki stored your Anki files in a folder called Anki in your Documents folder.
- On **Mac** computers, recent Anki versions store all their files in the `~/Library/Application Support/Anki2` folder. The Library folder is hidden by default, but can be revealed in Finder by holding down the option key while clicking on the Go menu. If you‚Äôre on an older Anki version, your Anki files will be in your `Documents/Anki` folder.
- On **Linux**, recent Anki versions store your data in `~/.local/share/Anki2`, or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/Anki2` if you have set a custom data path. Older versions of Anki stored your files in `~/Documents/Anki` or `~/Anki`.
