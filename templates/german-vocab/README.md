This is my German vocabulary card template! I use this card to train new words (not sentences). It includes a picture related to the meaning of the word, a hint that shows up when hovering over the picture and some extra information that appears when clicking on the arrow. For a preview, click [here](). If you want to download the template you can do so from here: [Download]().

## Study & Usage

- When you create a card, a reverse card will automatically be generated :

  - **German > Native language card**
  - **Native language > German card**

### DE > EN

<img src="./readme-images/image-20200704132359114.png" alt="image-20200704132359114" style="zoom:50%;" />

The front card displays the German word. The background consists of a blurred version of the uploaded image to allow for quizzing and in order to differentiate the cards.

<img src="./readme-images/image-20200704132455002.png" alt="image-20200704132455002" style="zoom:50%;" />

The back card shows the now clear image related to the German word. Hovering (mouse) or tapping on (mobile) the image will reveal the hint:

![Jul-04-2020 14-33-01](./readme-images/Jul-04-2020 14-33-01.gif)

The next area is the word area. Here we find the word in German, some examples and a tag that identifies the word type. This is very useful when trying to differentiate between trennbar and untrennbar verbs:

<img src="./readme-images/image-20200704133749851.png" alt="image-20200704133749851" style="zoom:50%;" />

Below the examples is an arrow which, upon clicking or tapping, will open a drop menu which reveals extra information about the word‚Äîe.g. fixed expressions or for forms:

![Jul-04-2020 14-33-22](./readme-images/Jul-04-2020 14-33-22.gif)

Finally, an English translation and a German definition are located at the bottom. √úben macht den Meister!

## EN > DE

<img src="./readme-images/image-20200704134142468.png" alt="image-20200704134142468" style="zoom:50%;" />

The front card shows a related image, a translation of the target vocabulary and a fill-in-the-blank example sentence. This is particularly useful not only for training vocabulary recall but also for practicing ancillary information such as conjugations and declensions.

<img src="./readme-images/image-20200704134257522.png" alt="image-20200704134257522" style="zoom:50%;" />

The back card is identical to the back card for DE > EN with the exception that the keyword in the example is styled differently.

### Input

1. This template has 9 inputs:

   1. **front:** target word
   2. **front+:** the target word + any additionaly information. When training the word "Mann," for example,  "Mann" should be entered in **front**, and "Mann, der" in **front+** so that both meaning and gender are quizzed.
   3. **translation**
   4. **example**
   5. **extra**
   6. **cover (picture)**
   7. **cover-tip (hint)**
   8. **definition**
   9. **word type** (trennbar, untrennbar, ...)

<img src="./readme-images/image-20200704134748648.png" alt="image-20200704134748648" style="zoom:50%;" />

<img src="/Users/elemarmar/Documents/web development/Repositories/my-anki-collection/templates/german-vocab/readme-images/image-20200704134648972.png" alt="image-20200704134648972" style="zoom:50%;" />

In this example only **front** is filled in, since this verb doesn't contain extra info. Below are two examples which demonstrate the difference between cards with and without **front+**:

Here, dealing with a noun,  **front+** reinforces both vocubulary recall as well as gender:

<img src="./readme-images/image-20200704134909849.png" alt="image-20200704134909849" style="zoom:50%;" />

> Note how it doesn't ask for "der Aufstand" --> we have to guess the gender!

<img src="./readme-images/image-20200704134941002.png" alt="image-20200704134941002" style="zoom:50%;" />

> **Front+** will be displayed on the back of the card unless the field is left empty, in which case, **Front** will be displayed instead.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: To hide words in the German example sentence, simply enter the desired words in **bold**:

> Notice how no extra information is provided in this example. Below is an example featuring extra info.

Last but not least, the image field, cover-tip field, definition and word type fields:

![image-20200704135904579](./readme-images/image-20200704135904579.png)

>  Images can simply be copied and pasted into the field. 

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Words entered in word type field must be entered in **bold**. In order to avoid unwanted grouping, it is important that the spaces between tags *not* be bold.  Bolded spaces will result in word grouping as seen below.

> ![image-20200704140121263](./readme-images/image-20200704140121263.png)

> To fix this, simply "unbold" the space between words:

Bear in mind I'm still working on improvements and cleaning up the code. If you have any suggestions, encounter any bugs or  would like me to design a card template for you, let me know! ü¶ä
